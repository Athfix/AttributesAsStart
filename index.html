        <h1>Attributes</h1>
        <p id="firstIntro">Well attributes are the one that are inserted in tags which are
            used for the purpose selection (classes, id, name), styling
            (style), adding source files (video, audio, images) also adding
            URL and links
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Athfix/AttributesAsStart/master/attr.png" width="90%"/>
        Along with it we have value attribute for inputs
<b>input type=”values"</b> and values includes text, password,
email, radio, range and many thing and source files like
<b>source src=”URL”</b> for videos, audio <b>img src=’URL’</b> for
image files and width and height for dimensions
<b> width=”100%”</b> and <b>height=”100%”</b> 
        </p>
        <h1>Adding the images</h1>
        <p id="secIntro">Well to add images in HTML, it must be with <img> tag were it
            is with attribute of (src) were we are able to add link of image
            well the extension of image must be either of .jpg, .png, .gif,
            .jpeg and the image tag here <b>img src=”URL”</b>
            if image links are to be brought from browsers Just right click
            on image and select open in new tab and copy the URL and
            paste it in src, But if the image is local just add the image in
            the folder were you are writing the HTML file and right click
            on the image then tap on copy path and paste the path in img
            src and save the file.
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Athfix/AttributesAsStart/master/img.png" width="100%"/>
        </p>
        <h1>Adding the links</h1>
        <p id="thiIntro">Well adding the URL is quite easy in VS code, you just need
            <b>a</b> tag which is with (href) tag built in and copy the URL
            anywhere and paste that here so after that you need to add
            text between a tag and boom here is the link you have
            created successfully in the browser you are with a text in blue
            color and underlined and that is how link looks like.<br/>
            <b> a href=”facebook.com” here is link for facebook</b><br/>
        <k style="text-decoration: underline;color:blue">here is link for facebook</k><br/>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Athfix/AttributesAsStart/master/link.png" width="100%"/>
        Well a tag is termed as anchor tag because it grabes links
which we are able to click.
        </p>
        <h1>Lists and forms in HTML</h1>
        <p id="fourIntro">Well just like the list which we create in any document like
            doc, txt, pdf we are able to create such list in HTML using
            <b>li</b> tag and there are 2 types of list ordered and unordered
            with using the tag <b>ol</b> and <b>ul</b></p>
